Title & key phrase & logo
=========================
We will use the title "jWitter" to imply a synergy between Twitter and
Jacobs.

Motto (key phrase): "Unleash your Jacobs Spirit (in 140 characters or less)"

Logo: We plan on having an epiphanic dove[1] inside the Jacobs Logo[2] to
remind the users that they can enjoy the freedom of their thoughts and share
this wonderful experience with others (no shades will be used).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
We have respected the title, key phrase and logo which we proposed in the design document. The logo was design in an even more prominent manner.



Overall look & feel
=========================
It is a relaxing and simultaneously inspiring corporate design with a simple
but functional and efficient meta bar at the top, a logo field in the left
upper corner that exploits high brightness to raise the level of recognition
and a trendy 3D effect realized with the help of an artistic natural
background.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The look and feel is indeed relaxing, with light tones and due to its innate intuitivity and ease of access, which is owned in part to a very light-weight page configuration and in part to the low number of components that do not confuse the user respecting the magical rule of 7.

Colors: primary / secondary / background
=========================

The dominant color will be white (RGB: #FFFFFFFF), because the white background
predominates. The text will largely be black (RGB: #FF000000), but the URLs
will be blue (RGB: #FF0000FF) and the timestamps ("posted almost 2 hours ago")
will be gray (RGB: #FF999999), to avoid distracting the user from the main
content.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
It is immediately observable by looking at the page that we have used the colors set forth before. It is also trivially provable that pi is n pi by 
using a relaxing eco system user design.

Window subdivision
=========================
In addition to the structure introduced at "Overall look & feel" we have made
the following design decisions:

The navigation bar will be fused with the meta bar to save space estate on the
page for a better user experience.

On the left side of the starting page, we will have a post composer to showcase
the preferred action in a prominent manner.

Having taken this design decisions, we target the "front door" home page
approach (have nice & appealing impressions first, information area later).

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The windows subdivision indeed follows our perspicuous proposed implementation,
concerning the fusion between the meta bar and navigation bar as well as presenting ourselves using a front door home page approach (have nice & appealing impressions first, information area later). However, we do not yet have the composer to showcase or, otherwise suggest, the preferred user action in a prominent manner because we have only designed the home page which is accesible to non-registered users. The composer, however, is behind the login wall.
